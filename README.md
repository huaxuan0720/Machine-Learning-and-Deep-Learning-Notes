# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Notes
&emsp;&emsp;This is a group of notes about how I learn machine learning and deep Learning. PS: I'm still learning......

&emsp;&emsp;This is my [blog link](<https://huaxuan0720.github.io/>). Each time I finish one note, I will update it to the blog and [github repository](<https://github.com/huaxuan0720/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Notes>) at the same time. My blogs are all written in Chinese, maybe when I get my master's degree, I will translate them into English. If you like my notes, give me a star on GitHub. :)
